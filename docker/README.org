#+TITLE: docker setup for DragonRuby

For the individuals who cannot run DragonRuby natively on their machines due to weird setups (in my case network setup), we can get it running in Docker!

*WARNING* Please read through the `Dockerfile` and `run_docker` files before trying this. There are some things I do there which could be potentially security risks, so you should be aware of what those are /before/ you try it out.

* Dependencies
This assumes a few things:

- nvidia gpu
- proprietary nvidia graphics drivers
- docker is installed on the system
- [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)
- pulseaudio

* Building
You only presumably need to build once. Call the build script as such:

#+begin_src shell-script
./build_docker
#+end_src

* Running
Copy the `run_docker` file to the root of your DragonRuby installation. From there, call `./run_docker`. Then, it will start up a docker where the current drgtk installation is mounted to the `/mnt` directory. From within there, you can call `./dragonruby`.

* Limitations
- cannot access the internet
- currently only works with nvidia graphics cards with the nvidia proprietary drivers installed
- currently only works with pulseaudio
- can probably be simplified to not use the whole `nvidia/cuda` base image
